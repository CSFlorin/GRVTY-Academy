## POST-CSS

### Introduction
In GRVTY we work with postcss. And you might be wondering what is post-css? 
That's a great question, so here are some resources so you can get a grip of it.

* [PostCSS Deep Dive: What You Need to Know](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/postcss-deep-dive-what-you-need-to-know--cms-24535)
* [PostCSS Quickstart Guide: Instant Setup Options](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/postcss-quickstart-guide-instant-setup-options--cms-24536)

Those are the two first installments of the Postcss series in webtuts, we encourage you to read them all [here](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/categories/postcss)

### Which plugins we use?

Well at this point you know that postcss works with plugins (at least I hope so) here is a list of all the plugins we currently use. If you want to add one more, chat with the development team and then add it here 😎
